	* ports/plt-scheme200/lalr.ss:
	* lalr.skl: a few bug fixes (reported by Florian Loitsch)

	* doc-src: ported the documentation to Skribe

2004-10-25    <dboucher@nuecho.com>

	* ports/stklos.decls: new port (thanks to Erick Gallesio).
	
	* examples/calc.scm: the initial environment is no longer
	initialized to a constant list.
	

2004-01-28   <dboucher@nuecho.com>

	* examples/calc.scm: enhanced version.

	* lalr.scm: various new features (error recovery, new 'expect:' option)

	* ports/plt-scheme200/lalr.ss:
	* ports/plt-scheme200/lalr-private.ss: updated version

2004-01-06     <dboucher@nuecho.com>

	* lalr.scm: optimized the handling of lookaheads for states which
	only have a default action that reduces a rule (this helps for
	interactive parsers), as suggested by Rouben Rostamian.

	* lalr.scm: modified the format of documentation comments. Will
	be compatible with my new documentation system.

	* ports/kawa/lalr.scm: removed. The port to Kawa is similar to
	(most of) all other ports.

2004-01-04    <dboucher@nuecho.com>

	* ports/guile.decls: File added.
	* Makefile, lalr.skl: added support for the port to Guile

2003-09-10    <dboucher@nuecho.com>

	* ports/kawa/lalr.scm: File added. It contains a version
	specific to the Kawa Scheme system. This version was necessary due
	to a limitation in the way defmacro operates with the compiler.
