.SH NAME
stklos \- An efficient Scheme System providing a powerful Object System

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B STklos
is a free Scheme System (nearly) conform to R5RS. The aim of this
implementation is to be fast as well as light. The implementation is
based on an ad-hoc Virtual Machine. 
.B STklos 
can also be compiled as a library, so that one can easily embed it 
in an application.
.LP
The salient points of STklos are:
.IP "" 4
- efficient and powerful object system based on CLOS providing:
.IP "" 8
+ Multiple Inheritance,
.IP "" 8
+ Generic Functions,
.IP "" 8
+ Multi-methods
.IP "" 8
+ an efficient MOP (Meta Object Protocol)
.IP "" 4
- a simple to use module system
.IP "" 4
- implemanents the full tower of numbers defined in R5RS
.IP "" 4
- easy connection to the GTK+ toolkit
.IP "" 4
- Perl compatible regular expressions thanks to the PCRE package.
.IP "" 4
- tail recursive calls are properly implemented

.SH OPTIONS
Here are the options available in the version @VERSION@ of 
.B stklos.

.IP "-l file, --load=file"
load 'file' before going interactive
.IP "-f file, --file=file"
use 'file' as program
.IP "-e sexpr, --execute=sexpr"
evaluate the given sexpr and exit
.IP "-b file, --boot-file=file"
use 'file' to boot the system instead of the default one
.IP "-q, --no-init-file"
quiet: do not load the user init file
.IP "-v, --version"
print program version and exit
.IP "-h, --help"
print this help and exit

.SH FILES

.IP "~/.stklos/stklosrc" 
This file is the user init file which is loaded when \fBstklos\fR
starts. Use the \fB-q\fR to avoid the loading of this file 


.SH VARIABLES

.IP "STKLOS_LOAD_PATH"
This is a colon-separated list of directories in which \fBstklos\fR
looks for loading files. It is used by functions such as \fBload\fR
or \fBtry-load\fR.

.IP "STKLOS_FRAMES"
This variable must contains an integer which indicates the number of
frames printed on an error. Use the value \fB0\fR for an unlimited
back-trace.
