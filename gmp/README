This is a GMPlite version.

This version is a new version built as a wrapper around the MPI
library (http://spinning-yarns.org/michael/mpi). It replaces the
previous version built with starting from the sources of an old
version of GMP (3.1.1) as transitive closure of the functions used in
src/numbers.c.

The rewriting was necessary because old GMPlite was hard to maintain
(it embeds asm code and is hard to understand). On the contrary MPI,
is simpler (it is basically one source file).

In any case, GMPlite is a poor replacement of GMP and should not be
used. It is a only used if there is no GMP library installed on the
system at configure time (otherwise the system GMP is used).
