STklos uses some libraries developped by other people.
These libraries are:


GMP: The Gnu MP library  
======================= 
If you have a version of GMP installed, it will be used. Otherwise, 
STklos uses a part of the MPI library which is provided in the package. 
A wrapper for the subset of the functions used by STklos is built on
top of MPI to build a GMP API compatible library. 
Note that STklos sources use only the GMP API.
