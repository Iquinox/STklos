    This is a version with important changes to support

    threads and Posix threads (aka pthreads). LURC threads are
    implemented using the LURC library, the Light ULM/Reactive library
    for C developed at INRIA. LURC supports the creation of
    synchronous cooperative threads, synchronizing and communicating
    with each other using signals in a deterministic scheduler (see
    http://www-sop.inria.fr/mimosa/Stephane.Epardaud/lurc for
    details).
