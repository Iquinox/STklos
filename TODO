THIS IS VERY OBSOLETE AND SHOULD BE REWRITTEN. 


* THINGS TO DO (NEXT RELEASES PLAN)

** Version 0.97 ... 
	- Terminate canvas implementation
	- Add new widgets that exist in 0.51 and have not been ported back
   	- Add GTk2 support
	- Add STk Posix support
	- ... 

** Version 0.98
	- autoload (and syntax-autoload) and modules as in STk?
	- Use  packages in all the library to hide functions which
	  should not be exported. Use a scheme similar to STk, such as
	  if a user redefines a standard function, it will not break
	  the library itself.
	- Tree widget
	- ...

* THINGS TO DO (BY CATEGORY)


**  STUFF TO PORT FROM STk
 - when-port-readable ...
 - ...


** COMPILER
 - Add goto optimisations
 - better handling of undefined symbols when compiling a module.

** MISC
 - Use packages in all the library to hide functions which should not be 
 exported. Use a scheme similar to STk, such as if a user redefines a 
 standard function, it will not break the library itself.
 - Make an interactive help command. Everything is ready for that.
