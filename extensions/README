*				STklos Extensions

You can find the following extensions modules in this directory
    

** ldap 

This is a proof of concept module. Don't take it as a finished
extension. This is a module that I have written because I need to
hack a rather large LDAP base in our school. It does what I need and
very little more. If you want to improve it to make something more
useful, I would be glad to add your contribution.
